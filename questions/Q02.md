## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer
- Base64
It's a way of encoding arbitrary binary data in ASCII text. Base64 allows you to express binary data using text characters from the Base64 set of 64 text characters. This is usually used when you have a set of data that you want to pass through some channel that might misinterpret some of the characters, but would not misinterpret Base64 characters, so you encode it using Base64 so that the data won't get misinterpreted. 

- Why 64?
Because you can generally rely on the same 64 characters being present in many character sets, and you can be reasonably confident that your data's going to end up on the other side of the wire uncorrupted.

- why is it used to construct a JWT?
because it's a very popular encoding format and it's very easy to use it in most of programming languages. Also, Base64url is URL-safe, so the tokens could be sent in the URL.
